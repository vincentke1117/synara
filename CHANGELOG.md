# Changelog

## 0.1.3 - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Added in-app thread recap support with provider-backed generation, cached recap state, current-state context, and tests around recap assembly.
- Added richer agent activity detail surfaces so subagent/task rows can be opened and inspected from the transcript flow.
- Added release notes for `0.1.3` to the built-in What's New / Release History data.

### Changed

- Reworked transcript, chat header, environment panel, Git action, branch toolbar, and queued composer rendering so busy sessions remain easier to scan.
- Computed repo diff totals once in `ChatView` and reused them across the header and environment panel, avoiding duplicate large-patch parsing during live updates.
- Streamlined archived-thread deletion through shared client helpers, including optimistic local removal, batched worktree-linked cleanup, and a single shell snapshot reconciliation.
- Made desktop update UI quieter during background polling and kept production web/server/desktop sourcemaps disabled by default unless explicitly enabled for diagnostics.
- Tightened terminal runtime cleanup, shell summary handling, provider activity ingestion, and session handoff safeguards.
- Refined composer attachment, reference chip, queued row, and compact control spacing for a cleaner release build.

### Fixed

- Fixed TypeScript exact-optional-property failures in optional callback pass-throughs.
- Fixed recap generation test doubles to use the shared `ThreadRecapGenerationInput` contract.
- Updated image attachment chip tests to match the current compact thumbnail UI.
- Preserved the final archived-thread and diff-total behavior with focused tests.
